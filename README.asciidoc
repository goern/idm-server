== Scope of this Document

The ansible module provided may lack features needed in other environments.

It will describe the IdM Service itself, as well as the configuration and
deployment of the service components.

== IdM Services

The IdM Service provides

 * a hierarchical Directory accessible via LDAPS
 * User management, incl. keys or certificates
 * Group management
 * single sign on for Windows and RHEL hosts
   - integration between Windows ActiveDirectory and RHEL IdM
   - username/password, ssh key, and kerberos based authentication
 * host and host identity (and groups of hosts) management
 * roles and policy management for MS Windows and RHEL platform

== Integration Scenarios

=== ID1: OpenShift Web Console

As a user with an account in the Linux Domain
I want to access the OpenShift Origin web console.

As an IT-Ops-Plt-Ops or IT-Mgmt-IT-Ops
I want to log on to Fedora Atomic Hosts,
so that I get authenticated by my username/password, ssh identity or kerberos ticket.

=== Ansible Inventory

To configure all solution components a Ansible module is provided. This may be
used with a corresponding inventory file to configure

 * the Fedora IdM components

[source]
------
include::../inventory.yml[]
------

=== Ansible Playbook

==== Prerequisites

Ansible will connect via ssh to each host it needs to configure. This connection
will be made as user `vagrant`. You will need to provide the ssh private key
to ansible in order to log in to and of the IdM server hosts.

==== Executing the Playbook

After providing the inventory and required configuration you can execute the
playbook by running `ansible-playbook --user=vagrant --private-key=vagrant_ssh_key --become-user=root --inventory ../inventory.yml site.yml site.yml roles/idm-server/tasks/add_std_roles.yml --tags "init_with_acme"`.
The IdM server will be initialized with a standard ACME Corp set of roles (implemented as groups).
If these groups already exists, the creation errors will be ignored.
